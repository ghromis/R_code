I wanted to find out which countries had most consistent  and fastest growth in the last half century.

There are 10 countries that had higher growth rate than the world average in at least 40 out of last 52 years.

Data by the World Bank: <br>
Low-income economies ($1,035 or less) <br>
Lower-middle-income economies ($1,036 to $4,085) <br>
Upper-middle-income economies ($4,086 to $12,615) <br>
High-income economies ($12,616 or more) <br>

As a group, fastest growing countries are middle income (especially upper middle income) countries.

Data by the World Bank.

If we look at the total growth multiple, we get a list that contains 5 of the same countries (Botswana, China, Korea, 
Singapore and Thailand).

GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)

So I wanted to see how these results correlate with non-income components of Human Development Index (life expectancy and education indicators). Although all of these countries have improved more than the US, It looks like income does not correlate perfectly with improved life. Although Singapore has twice the purchasing power of Korea, it has quite a bit lower non-income HDI. Similarly Botswana (presumably due to AIDS epidemic) has much lower HDI then itâ€™s income would warrant.
